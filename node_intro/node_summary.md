Summary of Node.js concept

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine, designed for server-side development. It is single-threaded, event-driven, and follows a non-blocking I/O model, making it efficient for real-time applications.Unlike traditional web servers that use multiple threads, Node.js uses a single-threaded, event-driven architecture with non-blocking I/O, making it highly scalable and efficient for handling multiple concurrent requests.

Key Features:
 -> Asynchronous & Non-blocking – Handles multiple requests efficiently.
 -> Single-threaded & Event-driven – Uses an event loop for scalability.
 -> Fast Execution – Uses the V8 engine to compile JavaScript into machine code.
 -> Modular System – Uses built-in and third-party modules via NPM (Node Package Manager).
 -> Cross-Platform – Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Conclusion:
Node.js is a powerful, asynchronous, event-driven runtime that allows JavaScript to be used for server-side development. It is fast, scalable, and widely used in modern web applications, APIs, microservices, and real-time applications.
